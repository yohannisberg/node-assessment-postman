# Node Assessment

### Setup

1. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
2. Create a file called ```server.js```. All of your server code and endpoints will be in this file.
3. Create a file called ```usersCtrl.js```.  In this file you will write all of the functions for your endpoints.
  - Require the ```userData.json``` file in the ```usersCtrl.js``` file.
  - Don't forget to export the functions that you create in the ```usersCtrl.js``` file.

**NOTE:** You *must* use port **3000** during this assessment.    

### Import Postman tests

**A file named ```node_assessment.postman_collection.json``` is inside the ```postman_testing``` folder. We will import this file in postman.**

1. Open Postman.
2. In the top left corner, click on the ```Import``` button.
  - See ```images``` folder, ```image1.png```.
3. Make sure that ```Import File``` is selected / underlined, then click on ```Choose Files```.

  - You will need to select the ```node_assessment.postman_collection.json``` file (located in the ```postman_testing``` folder of this repo).

#### Running the tests

1. Select ```Collections``` on the left panel of Postman (next to History).
2. Next to the ```node_assessment``` collection, click on the right arrow.
  - See ```images``` folder, ```image2.png```.
3. Select the blue ```Run``` button. This will open up the collection runner.
  - See ```images``` folder, ```image3.png```.
4. When you are ready to run the tests, select the blue ```Start Test``` button at the bottom. When all tests have passed, show your mentor.

**NOTE:** You need to be running ```nodemon``` in order to successfully run the Postman tests. There are **41** tests that need to pass.

**IMPORTANT:** The Postman tests manipulate some of the user data. Before you run the Postman tests, you should restart nodemon. You can do this in the terminal while nodemon is running by typing ```rs``` and then pressing ```enter```.

### Endpoints

**Reminder:** You *must* use port **3000** for this assessment.

Write your endpoints in ```server.js```.

1. ```'GET' /api/users```

Respond with the entire users array, with status 200.

This endpoint can be called with one of these queries, which you should be prepared to address:

- favorites: Return all users who have this favorites in their list of favorites.
- age: Return all users who have an age *less* than this age.
- lastname: Return all users whose last name matches.
- email: Return just the user object of the user whose email matches.

2. ```'GET' /api/users/``` + userId

The test will a GET request with the userId as a parameter to this endpoint. Remember, request params will come as strings. If the user is found, respond with status 200 and send that user information.

If no user was found, respond with a status of ```404``` and ```null```.
**NOTE:** You will need to use ```.json()``` instead of ```.send()``` when sending just ```null```.


3. ```'GET' /api/admins```

Respond with status 200, and an array of all users who are admins.

4. ```'GET' /api/nonadmins```

Respond with status 200, and an array of all non-admin users.

5. ```'GET' /api/user_type/``` + userType

Respond with status 200, and an array of all users that match the userType parameter.

6. ```'PUT' /api/users/``` + userId

A user object will be sent in the request body. You should update the user object that has an id that matches the userId parameter.

Return with status 200, and the entire array of user objects *after* you have updated the correct user object.

7. ```'POST' /api/users```

A user object will be sent in the request body. You will need to add an id to this user object before adding it to the users array.

The user IDs are sequential. If the last user object had an ID of 100, the new user object should have an ID of 101 and the next user object added should have an ID of 102. The Postman test will add multiple user objects and check the IDs.

You should return status 200 along with the entire array of user objects *after* the new user object has been added.

8. ```'DELETE' /api/users/``` + userId

The test will DELETE with a param of a userId. You should remove the user with matching userId, returning status 200 and the array of user objects *after* the correct user object has been deleted.

### When all 41 tests are passing, show your mentor.
